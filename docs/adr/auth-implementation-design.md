# Authentication & Profile Management Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Study Bee requires a comprehensive authentication and profile management system to enable user-specific features like flashcards, live sessions, arena matches, and analytics.

## Decision
Implement a full-featured authentication system using Supabase Auth with the following components:

### Core Architecture
- **AuthContext**: React context for global auth state management
- **ProtectedRoute**: HOC for route protection
- **AuthForm**: Unified login/signup component with tabs
- **ProfileForm**: Comprehensive profile editing interface

### Database Schema
- Extended `profiles` table with comprehensive user data
- Avatar storage bucket with proper RLS policies
- Automatic profile creation trigger on user signup

### Key Features
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Email/password authentication
   - Automatic session persistence
   - Password reset functionality
   - Real-time auth state updates

2. **Profile Management**
   - Complete profile editing
   - Avatar upload with Supabase Storage
   - Learning preferences management
   - Educational background tracking

3. **Security**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Secure avatar upload paths
   - Protected routes with automatic redirects

### Implementation Details
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- React Query for profile data management
- shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states

## Consequences
### Positive
- Enables all user-specific features
- Secure and scalable authentication
- Great user experience with loading states
- Type-safe implementation

### Negative
- Requires user registration for full functionality
- Additional complexity in routing and state management

## Next Steps
1. Integrate auth with existing features (flashcards, arena, sessions)
2. Add email verification workflow
3. Implement social authentication providers
4. Add user onboarding flow
