# ADR: Enhanced Spaced Repetition with Reinforcement Learning

## Status
✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Production Ready

## Context
The existing spaced repetition system uses a basic SM-2 algorithm that doesn't adapt to individual user learning patterns or optimize for long-term retention. Users have varying cognitive abilities, learning preferences, and response patterns that a static algorithm cannot accommodate effectively.

## Decision
Implement an Enhanced SM-2+ algorithm with Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization that:

1. **Policy Gradient Engine**: Uses a neural network policy to optimize scheduling decisions
2. **Reward System**: Multi-dimensional reward calculation based on accuracy, efficiency, retention, and engagement
3. **Personalization**: Adapts to individual user performance metrics and learning patterns
4. **Real-time Optimization**: Continuously improves scheduling decisions based on user feedback

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. PolicyGradientEngine
- **Purpose**: Neural network-based policy for action selection
- **Input**: Learning state (easiness factor, consecutive correct, response time ratio, etc.)
- **Output**: Scheduling actions (interval multiplier, difficulty adjustment, confidence boost)
- **Learning**: Policy gradient updates with exploration-exploitation balance

#### 2. RewardCalculator
- **Accuracy Reward**: +1.0 for correct, -0.5 for incorrect
- **Efficiency Reward**: Optimal response time around expected duration
- **Retention Reward**: Higher rewards for longer successful intervals
- **Engagement Reward**: Appropriate time investment based on difficulty
- **Long-term Reward**: Pattern analysis over review history

#### 3. EnhancedSM2Algorithm
- **Traditional SM-2**: Base algorithm for interval calculation
- **RL Enhancement**: Policy-driven modifications to intervals and difficulty
- **User Profiling**: Personalized metrics storage and retrieval
- **Model Persistence**: Export/import policy weights for production deployment

### Data Flow
```
User Review → State Extraction → Policy Action → Enhanced SM-2 → 
Update Schedule → Calculate Reward → Policy Update → Store Metrics
```

## Implementation Details

### State Representation
```typescript
interface RLState {
  easinessFactor: number;        // Current card difficulty (1.3-2.5)
  consecutiveCorrect: number;    // Streak of correct answers
  responseTimeRatio: number;     // Current/average response time
  retentionRate: number;         // User's overall retention percentage
  streakDays: number;           // Days of consistent study
  difficultyLevel: number;      // Card difficulty (1-10)
}
```

### Action Space
```typescript
interface RLAction {
  intervalMultiplier: number;    // 0.5-2.5x interval adjustment
  difficultyAdjustment: number;  // ±0.2 easiness factor modification
  confidenceBoost: number;       // 0-0.3 confidence increase
}
```

### Policy Network
- **Architecture**: Simple linear policy with softmax output
- **Parameters**: 6 state features × 3 actions = 18 weights
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001 with gradient clipping
- **Exploration**: ε-greedy with 10% exploration rate

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Readiness
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to basic SM-2 on RL failures
- **Model Persistence**: Policy weights stored in user profiles
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics tracking and alerting
- **A/B Testing**: Gradual rollout with control groups

### Backwards Compatibility
